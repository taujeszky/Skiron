# Skiron — Claude session guide

A murder-mystery deduction game: alibi timelines on a floor plan, cases generated and
proven fair by a pure-TypeScript engine, dressed by an LLM whose every sentence is
verified before the player sees it. Sibling of `../newsignpost` and `../newloopy`
(solver-backed puzzles) and of `../NewX` (LLM authors, engine verifies).

The design and the work breakdown are in `docs/plan/`. **Read `docs/plan/README.md` in
full before doing anything**, then `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (what the code actually does,
and why, where a choice was open), then the file for the wave you are on. Work one wave
at a time and keep the status table at the bottom of that README, and the last section of
this file, up to date.

## Ask the owner first

- Creating the GitHub repository (`taujeszky/Skiron`) or pushing to it.
- The first Cloudflare Pages deploy.
- Any paid batch of API calls — say how many calls you expect.
- Adding Skiron to the portfolio catalog in `../index.html`.
- Changing anything listed under "Locked by the owner" in the plan.

Local commits on `main` are fine without asking.

## Stack

- **SvelteKit + Svelte 5 (runes)** with `adapter-static`, SSR off, layout prerendered;
  the SPA fallback is `404.html` (see gotchas). Components use runes; shared game state
  uses `svelte/store` writables in `src/lib/game/controller.ts`, as in Signpost.
- **Vitest** with a standalone `vitest.config.ts` that aliases `$lib` by hand and does
  not load the SvelteKit plugin. Tests cover pure TypeScript under `src/lib/**`; the UI
  is untested.
- **`vite-node`** runs the Node-side tools (`tools/sim.mjs`, later the authoring CLI) so
  they can import engine TypeScript through the same `$lib` alias — it reuses
  `vitest.config.ts` for exactly that reason.
- **No Tauri yet.** Keep browser-only APIs (storage, IndexedDB, workers) behind small
  modules so a shell can be added.
- **Gemini** via `@google/genai`, behind `src/lib/llm/provider.ts`. All model ids in
  `src/lib/llm/models.ts`.
- Dependency versions are **pinned exactly**, matching what Signpost has proven on this
  machine.
- This machine is **Windows on ARM**.

## Commands

```sh
npm install --ignore-scripts --legacy-peer-deps   # BOTH flags are mandatory — see gotchas
node scripts/patch-workerd.cjs                    # after any install (postinstall is skipped)
npm test                       # engine tests. Run after ANY engine change.
npm run test:watch             # same, watching
npm run check                  # svelte-check; keep at 0 errors 0 warnings
npm run dev                    # dev server on :1430 (strictPort)
npm run sim                    # generate hundreds of cases per preset, print the table
npm run build                  # static PWA into build/
npm run preview                # serve build/ locally
npm run deploy                 # build + wrangler pages deploy (ask first)
npx svelte-kit sync            # regenerates .svelte-kit/tsconfig.json if check/test fail
                               # with "Cannot find module ./.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json"
```

## Critical invariants (the plan explains each)

1. **The engine owns every fact.** The LLM cannot add, remove or alter a clue. Only
   evidence cards are canon; prose is decoration.
2. **Every case is fair, certified twice:** the tier-capped deduction solver finishes,
   and the independent exhaustive solver returns exactly the true answer.
3. **Deduction rules must be sound** — forced eliminations only. The oracle tests guard
   this; a new rule joins that guard.
4. **Determinism.** Same case ID ⇒ byte-identical case. No `Math.random`, `Date` or DOM
   in `src/lib/engine/`. Bump the ID version if the RNG, iteration order or any generator
   step must change.
5. **Accusation, Check and win detection never go through a solver.** They compare with
   the stored truth, so a solver bug cannot hand out a bogus win.
6. **No LLM prose reaches the player unverified.** Parse-back equality, or the template
   sentence. The template renderer covers every clue type.
7. **Innocents never lie.** With lying on, testimony by `s` asserts `s ≠ culprit ⇒ φ`.
   The full statement bank must leave the case fair.
8. **Runtime model calls never receive the truth, the culprit or unearned cards.** The
   interrogation model only ever sees what the player is about to see.
9. **The API key never enters a file, a URL or a log.**
10. **`TRIAL_BUDGET` is part of the grade.**

## Gotchas

- **`npm install` MUST be run with `--ignore-scripts --legacy-peer-deps` here.**
  - `--ignore-scripts`: wrangler's `workerd` has no win32-arm64 binary and its install
    script aborts the whole install. Because that also skips `postinstall`, run
    `node scripts/patch-workerd.cjs` by hand afterwards so `wrangler pages deploy`
    works. Never use `wrangler dev` here.
  - `--legacy-peer-deps`: without it npm 11.4.2 dies with
    `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'edgesOut')` while walking peers. The chain
    is vitest → optional peer `@vitejs/devtools-vitest` → peer `vitest@*` → vitest 5 →
    optional peer `@vitest/browser-playwright`, and arborist trips over the optional
    peer. Pinning versions does not help; the flag skips the walk. (Measured
    2026-09-19; Signpost predates the vitest-5 publish and so never hit it.)
- **The SPA fallback is `404.html`, not `index.html`.** The root layout prerenders, so
  `index.html` is the real home page; an `index.html` fallback would overwrite it with an
  empty shell (the adapter says so, in a line easy to miss).
- **Headless-browser testing:** Chrome's CacheStorage fails when `--user-data-dir` is
  deeply nested (the Claude scratchpad qualifies), and service workers then silently fail
  to install. Use a short path such as `C:/Users/<user>/AppData/Local/Temp/chp9230`.
- **Driving the real app** settles "does this really happen in the game?" without a test
  framework: see the CDP notes in `../newsignpost/CLAUDE.md`. Mind the dev port (:1430)
  and the HMR second-instance trap described there.
- vitest sometimes swallows `console.log`; write debug output to a file instead.
- `../index.html` (the portfolio catalog) has very long lines of embedded art and cannot
  be read whole; read it in slices.
- For Node-side Gemini image calls and `sharp`, copy what already works in
  `../catalog-art`, including how it reads the key.

## Conventions

- Engine tests live next to the code as `*.test.ts`, run in Node, no DOM.
- Match the surrounding code's comment density and naming. Comments explain why, and
  record measurements where a number was chosen by measuring.
- Tune generator presets from the `npm run sim` table, never by feel, and record the table
  in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- When the plan turns out to be wrong, change the plan file in the same commit and say
  why.

## State of the project (2026-09-19)

**Waves 0 and 1 done. Wave 2 in progress.** 284 tests green in ~2.5s, `npm run check` at
0/0 over 319 files.

- **Wave 0** — toolchain: SvelteKit + Svelte 5 + Vitest + adapter-static, `vite-node` for
  Node tools, generated icons, PWA manifest (no service worker yet — wave 4).
- **Wave 1** — the engine owns the truth. `types.ts`/`axioms.ts` (the contract and
  `isLegal`), `map/` (recursive dissection, doors, SVG geometry, ASCII view), `clues/`
  (all 17 kinds behind one registry), `world/simulate.ts`, `solver/exhaustive.ts` (the
  oracle), `caseId.ts`, `tools/inspect.mjs`.
- **Wave 2 so far** — `solver/state.ts`, tiers 0 and 1, `solve.ts` and `solver.test.ts`
  (the soundness oracle). Still to come: tiers 2-4, `difficulty.ts`, `explain.ts`,
  `hint.ts`.

Things a later wave will want to know, beyond what ARCHITECTURE.md records:

- **`npm run inspect`** prints a floor plan as ASCII and an evening as a person x slot
  table. It is the fastest way to see what the engine is actually producing.
- The engine was reviewed adversarially after wave 1 (independent re-implementations of
  every clue kind, differential fuzzing of the solver against brute-force enumeration of
  every legal world). No unsoundness was found. What *was* found was that determinism had
  no guard at all — see `golden.test.ts` and `purity.test.ts`, and ARCHITECTURE.md §6.

Next step: wave 2 tiers 2-4 (counting, trust, hypothesis), then `explain.ts` and
`hint.ts`.
